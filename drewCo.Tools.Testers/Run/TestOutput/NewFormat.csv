2010,Macauley Vineyards,Old Vine Zinfandel,Zinfandel,Napa,United States,R,,,2019,,1,,750 mL,$45.00,Only 375 cases made.  "This is perhaps the smoothest  silkiest and most seductive tasting Zinfandel I’ve ever made.  The color is an amazing and dark garnet followed by richness and ripeness found in Zins that come only ever so often. The aromatics are well stacked in the glass beginning with sweet red fruit and flowed by barrel vanillin and sweet cocoa. Lastly the typical Zin white pepper and spice finds its place in the furthermost layers of the nose. Moving from the aromatics to the first taste  getting to enjoy this wine is a much anticipated event. The flavors are a pleasant twist of blackberry  vanilla  cassis and sweet density from old vine age supported by the oak. Tannin and acid are interlaced as well offering plenty for this rich Zinfandel to support itself upon. A polished and pleasing wine that rides the fine line of ripeness with textured mouthfeel and finish that satisfies for over 45 seconds after the first taste. I would anticipate this wine drinking well from inception to 2019 and well beyond." - Kirk Venge  Winemaker,Highly recommended by Terry at Schneider's.

On the palate  the bright cherry opens the show  then evolves into a lush  sweetly spiced plum pudding  coating the mouth with a velvety richness. The wine then develops an intense mineral note  adding yet another dimension  lending way to silky tannins and a lengthy finish. Situated in the southern alluvial plains of the Russian River Valley  Dairyman Vineyard’s proximity to the Pacific Ocean results in a cool morning fog and afternoon coastal breezes that elongate the growing season. This gives us small  concentrated and flavorful berries  producing bright cherry characteristics  brown spices  and a keen minerality overlaid with a rich  velvety mouth feel.

Big  well-structured  soft tannins and a lovely long finish. Only one bottle left -- sob!,  The Odyssey Vineyard is located right next to the famed Stagecoach Vineyard and has a similar stylized taste of other nice Syrahs made in this viticultural are like Krupp Brothers and Tallulah. Arger-Martucci is one of those top boutique Napa houses that only release their vintages when the wine is drinking optimally so this wine has only been released in the past year. 2007 is one of the top vintages in the last decade and it is getting quite rare to find these wines now as they got snapped up shortly after release. These Mountain vines from the Odyssey and Isabella Vineyards are low yielding and sit at an elevation of 1 250 and 1 350 feet. This wine spent 11 months in primarily new American oak. Only about 750 cases were produced. Penetrating aromas of crème de cassis  dark cherries  licorice and white pepper.

2011,Quinta do Crasto,Douro Valley Reserva ,Touriga Nacional/Franca,Douro,Portugal,R,,,2025,,7,,750 ML,$67.00 ,Quinta do Crasto Reserva Old Vines shows a complex aroma  with the fruit and the oak very well integrated and revealing spicy nuances. Intense and deep on the palate. The firm tannic structure gives great balance to the wine  with a long and lingering finish. , This wine pairs very well with rich red meat or game dishes. Critical Acclaim RP94 The Wine Advocate - "The 2011 Reserva Old Vines (around 70 years of age on average) spent 18 months in 65% new and 35% used barriques (85% French  the rest American). The used barriques were previously new on the 2010 Reserva Old Vines. About the only bad thing you can say about this is that it is too marked by oak in its youth  but that is always true when it is young. That will become much better in time. Some cellaring will provide additional complexity as well  but it is otherwise quite approachable now even if not showing us all that it has to give. For my money  this is easily on the short list as a contender for “Best Reserva Old Vines” ever  because of its combination of concentration  lift  structure and superb balance. This is not the wine in the lineup that will always make you go “wow.” There is not a hint of bombast. However  it does everything beautifully  and balance is its hallmark. Even as it tightens with air  it proves how harmonious it is  showing off its finesse  crispness and focus. The fruit always seems fresh and lively here  never ponderous. The next day it hardly seemed changed. This should age pretty nicely. If all that is not enough  it is pretty tasty  too  a wine that will be hard to dislike on all fronts. Considering the price point  this is a "can’t miss" buy. There were 93 000 bottles produced. "  WE94 Wine Enthusiast - "A dark and powerfully rich wine from one of the top quintas in the Douro. It shows great concentration from the old vines. With its weight  dark fruits and dense tannins  it needs to age in order to bring out the solid wood and black  brooding character of the wine.

Best from 2017 through 2032. 300 cases made. Wine Advocate: Drink: 2016 - 2025 Composed of sweet berry fruit and floral tones that are embellished with heavier layers of toasted oak and hazelnut. The wine shows budding complexity and needs a few more years to find balance. The Cannubi cru often shapes Nebbiolo with a large floral component including red rose and dried lavender. You definitely get a sense of that in the refined 2010 vintage. Soft tannins and sour cherry flavors characterize the finish.

The nose is impressively aromatic and sets the table for a wine that has a compelling  rich taste profile. Aromas of dark chocolate covered cherries  and dark raspberry with notes of mocha  and toasty vanilla oak. A big  expressive and luscious palate that deserves cellar time. An expressive and delicious fruit profile of blackberry pie  cherry  toffee  cassis  dark chocolate  coffee  violets and sweet vanilla oak. The wine is complex with a distinguished and pleasing finish. Best enjoyed through 2023. Napa Valley’s Celadon restaurant features the inspired cuisine of Chef Marcos Uribe. Pair this delightful Cabernet with his specialties including crispy soy-braised pork belly  beef satay with spicy peanut sauce  Akaushi hangar steak  jerk marinated pork porterhouse and Moroccan Lamb shank with almond couscous.,  Winemaking Notes  The mature grapes are gently harvested by skilled vineyard workers who also know to avoid under ripe or damaged clusters. Such “field sorting” makes processing the grapes at the winery much easier and quicker. The grapes are first destemmed and then lightly crushed before being transferred to small stainless steel and oak open-top fermentors. Fermentation is allowed to commence naturally  and the wild yeast provide for some interesting flavor and aroma characteristics to develop before a winery yeast strain completes the fermentation. Regular punch downs promote extraction  provide oxygen for the yeast and also moderate temperatures by breaking up any hot spots in the cap. Once it’s dry  the wine is pressed and aged for 14 months in mostly neutral but a few new French oak barrels.  Tasting Notes  Aromas of boysenberries  violets  vanilla and dried herbs open to flavors of licorice  ripe blueberry and plum. Hints of nutmeg and oak round out the palate and gentle tannins invoke a supple mouth feel.  ,Wine Rack 4,Row 1/bin 2
2010,Canoe Ridge Vineyard,Reserve Cherry Street Red Wine Blend,,,,R,,,2020,,4,,750 mL,$37.00,Frontier Canoe Ridge Vineyard 2010 Reserve Cherry Street Red Blend Horse Heaven HillsCanoe Ridge Vineyard is one of Washington State’s most recognized wineries  with an estate vineyard in the Horse Heaven Hills American Viticultural Area  focused on Cabernet Sauvignon  Merlot and Chardonnay. It is located at the center part of the state  along the Columbia River on the southern border of the state. The “Canoe Ridge” name is based on the ridge landmass near the vineyard  where famed explorers Lewis & Clark named this crest of land on their 1805 exploration. From the river  the adventurers thought the ridge resembled an overturned canoe. The winery celebrates 20 years of winemaking in 2014  and has earned more than 30 scores of 90 points or higher from critical wine publications such as Wine Spectator  Wine Enthusiast  Wine & Spirits  and Tasting Panel Magazine. This year  its 2010 Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon was named a “Year’s Best Cabernet” in Wine & Spirits Magazine.WinemakingWinemaker Bill Murray  with more than 20 years of winemaking experience  honors the old world style-winemaking traditions for which Canoe Ridge is beloved. The wines are made with structure and softness  and pair to a variety of cuisines. The winery features several 1 000 to 6 000 gallon fermenters  sized to complement fermentation by vineyard blocks (helping monitor quality as well as control for blending options). Murray enjoys experimentation with yeasts as well as a diverse cooperage of French  American and European oak. Depending on the varietal and program  wines spend a minimum of 18-24 months in oak.VineyardsPlanted in 1989 our estate vineyard in the Horse Heaven Hills AVA is comprised of 182 prolific acres. Perched on a ridge  the vines are planted on their own roots on a sloping ridge at 425-740 feet in elevation. Here  the well-drained sandy loam soils allow deep rooting. Cool nights provide ideal temperatures for excellent sugar to acid balance  and low rainfall (about 6-8” annually) translates to excellent flavor concentration. The vineyard’s latitude and south- and north-facing orientations help vines soak up more than 17 hours of sunshine per day at the peak of summer  resulting in rich  fully mature flavors and the river winds offer well-developed  fine tannins. Horse Heaven Hills AVAEstablished in 2005  the Horse Heaven Hills growing area is home to more 90+ scores of Cabernet Sauvignon than anywhere else in Washington State.-Precipitation: Average of eight inches annually  usually during dormancy; very limited irrigation prevents vine canopy growth and results in well-balanced grape characteristics.-Topography: Mostly south-facing sloped  well-drained sandy soils dotted with dry plains  lending optimal sun exposure for ripening and protective air drainage  ideal in winter months.-Temperature: Warmer growing season fully matures grapes earlier in the harvest season (decreasing the risk of fall frost).-Wind: Brisk wind patterns contribute to less of a leaf canopy and more sun exposure to help with ripening while naturally preventing pests. , Technical DetailsAppellation: Horse Heaven HillsGrape Source: Canoe Ridge VineyardBlend: 54% Syrah  30% Malbec  16% GrenacheVintage: 2010Harvest Date: October 2010Yeast: D254Oak: American & French  30% NewFining: NoneBottled: May 2013TA: 6.2 g/lRS: NoneML: 100%Cases Produced: 504Release Date: August 2013  [Information provided by Precept Wines] ,Wine Rack 3,Row 5/bin 5

2014,Obsidian Cellars,Reserve Pinot Noir,Pinot Noir,Willamette Valley,United States,R,,,2022,,4,,750 mL,$40.00,The Obsidian from 2012 was a very nice wine  2013 was skipped because of the weak vintage (they only release their signature label in the better vintages) and 2014 is their best Pinot Noir yet. This is a blend from their top estate vineyards in the Willamette Valley which include Daffodil  Wolf Hill and Newton. I recently met in the Willamette Valley and sampled a large selection of their barrels with the winemaking team and this vintage shines on every front. The weather completely cooperated and helped produce rich and delicious wines that are lush and fruit forward. This wine is grown in unique soil that is well known for the Obsidian  as it is for red volcanic Jury soil. Obsidian is naturally occurring volcanic glass. When lava from a volcano cools rapidly  it causes an “obsidian flow.” This sharp edged glass is a big part of the history of the Willamette Valley  as Native Americans utizlied it extensively to create cutting tools. This wine is too delicious to not enjoy now  but it certainly has a long-term ability to age  and will gain complexity. This tiny production 100% Pinot Noir is a rich and generous red that includes a dazzling inner core of loaded  fresh cut fruit. It is predominantly red cherries  with red raspberries  crème de cassis  and wild strawberries  with touches of red flowers  smoke and a spice box. It finishes quite nicely. Sampled in the summer of 2015 in barrel  and the fall of 2015 in bottle with consistent tasting notes., ,Pinot/Burgundy Rack,Row 1/bin 1

Rating: 94+", Spoke to Jim  the GM  sez iut's a very complex wine  medium-bodied  would recommend letting it rest for 3-5 years before drinking  tho it's approachable now with decanting. Wineery produces just 5 000 cases a year.  The harvest was one of the earliest on record  beginning on August 1st for the whites. A little rain fell in September  but it didn’t seem to have much impact as sunny  drying conditions filled in after the rains and the vineyards dried out quickly. Cool  sunny  and dry conditions prevailed through October and kept sugars and acids in balance  allowing for a little extra time on the vine for maturing flavors and phenolics and leaving a healthy  ripe  and concentrated crop ready for picking. On the whole  about two weeks earlier than average  and a lot of growers are calling it a “near perfect” vintage — an even-tempered growing season that yielded a good-sized crop of small  concentrated berries. Beautiful weather with really no extremes and not too much rain has growers singing the praises of this excellent vintage  which produced another large crop of healthy  balanced fruit and very high-quality wines. We give it a very strong buy recommendation  as these are wines many believe will rival or even surpass the 2012s — high praise for sure! Big  powerful reds; bright  lively  and rich whites. HYPERLINK "https://www.wineaccess.com/search/varietal/pinot_noir/"Pinot Noir was a particular success in most regions  with optimum ripeness and very good acidities too.

It sports a deep ruby color  full body  terrific Grenache notes of black raspberries  scorched earth  currants and roasted herbs  sweet tannin and a killer finish. It’s more streamlined and elegant than the 2007 or 2010  but should surpass the 2009  which seems to be on a fast evolutionary track. Didier Negron has been the winemaker at this remarkable estate since 2001  and he’s yet to put a foot wrong. It’s important to realize that the estate makes four Châteauneuf du Pape cuvées: the entry level Les Olivets (which was first made in 1955) from younger vines and completely destemmed; the Cuvee Reserve from a single vineyard and 70-80% Grenache  and the rest Syrah and Mourvèdre  aged in foudre and oak tanks; the Cuvee Prestige based on 70% Grenache  20% Syrah and the rest mostly Mourvèdre that’s aged in foudre  oak tanks and demi-muids; and the smallest production cuvée (there’s normally just 100 cases produced)  the Le Secret des Sabon based mostly on Grenache., The 2015 Châteauneuf du Pape Prestige includes slightly more Syrah than the other cuvées and is 70% Grenache  20% Syrah  5% Mourvèdre and the rest a mix of permitted varieties. It’s easily the largest  richest and most full-bodied of the lineup and has lots of blackberry  plum  peppery herbs and roasted herb characteristics. Like all of the 2015s here  it has serious purity  as well as ripe tannin.  WS: There's a velvety  caressing mouthfeel to the waves of Linzer Torte  warm cassis and raspberry pate de fruit flavors  laced with black tea  mulled spice  singed alder and melted licorice notes.

2014,David Hill Vineyards and Winery,Reserve Pinot Moir,Pinot Noir,Willamette Valley,United States,R,,,2022,,1,,750 mL,$38.00,,The 2014 vintage in Oregon may be remembered as the vintage of a lifetime. From bud break through harvest  growers and winemakers throughout the state experienced an almost ideal growing season that delivered a record amount of exceptional  balanced fruit.  The vintage’s milestones averaged two weeks early from bud break through harvest  with some sites and varieties maturing as much as three weeks early. Growing conditions were mostly dry and warmer than normal throughout the spring providing a great environment for flowering and fruit set. The result was large clusters that ripened evenly over the course of the warm  dry summer. The 2014 vintage broke the previous record for heat accumulation during the growing season  set in 2006.  This record was broken not by the daytime highs but rather the overnight lows being higher than normal for most of the year. This allowed the grapes to continue ripening through veraison without putting heat stress on the vines.  This is one of those rare vintages when you have high quality and high quantity simultaneously. From the standpoint of weighing quantity against quality  it was one of the best perhaps as the wines are very good and range from refreshing and vibrant to rich and ripe. The Pinot Noirs are deeper in color and range from the low 13’s to lower 14’s in alcohol percent. I believe the consumer will love these wines as they will be similar to the 2009 vintage.  ,Pinot/Burgundy Rack & Josh's Rack,Row 2/bin 2

2014,Herdade do Peso,Colheita Tinto,45-35-10 Syr-Gren.-Touriga Nac.,Alentejo,Portugal,R,,,2028,,6,,750 mL,$20.00,,  This wine is a blend of 45% Syrah  35% Alicante Bouschet  and 20% Touriga Nacional. Each variety takes on a different role in the wine. The Syrah brings structure  earth  and spice; the Alicante Bouschet adds a dimension of juicy dark fruit; and the Touriga Nacional pulls everything together with a floral lift. The wine reminds me of a cross between a Cote Rotie and a Chateauneuf du Pape - but at a fraction of the price.,,
