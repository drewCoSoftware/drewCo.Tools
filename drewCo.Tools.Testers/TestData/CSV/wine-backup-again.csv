Penfolds		St. Henri Shiraz	2002	Premium	Shiraz	750 ML	Australia	Barossa Valley	43.00		Wine Rack 2	Row 5/bin 1			12		2018	RP: A classic effort (91% shiraz, 9% cabernet sauvignon). Aged for 14 months in old 1,460-litre vats. A stunningly rich, old-style shiraz offers up scnets of Provencal herbs, bay leaves, blackberries, black currants, new saddle leather and loads of meaty characteristics. Rich, texturally opulent and soft, this heady offering should drink well for 10-12 years. 	I love St. Henri Shirazes.  From Dave and Sharon Park--get well gift.

Winery: a dark, opaque violet color. The nose is packed full of ripe black berry fruit aromas, with layers of eucalyptus, black pepper, and mineral notes. The mouthfeel is full, yet supple, with a soft, generous texture. On the palate, the wine offers rich, concentrated flavors of cassis and black currant fruit interwoven with notes of cigar box, sweet spice and vanilla. The finish is long and lingering, with well structured tannins and racy acidity.		Yes																94		No	2019-01-25 13:32:37	2019-01-25 13:32:37

Wine Enthusiast; February 2004 This vintage, this Shiraz isn't filtered. It's elegant, and not an unruly blockbuster as many other 02's are, with juicy black fruit and a little buttercream for good measure. Its chalky tannins are lovely.

This interesting Cabernet was grown in various parts of the valley, but you can detect a cool-climate influence in the acidity and especially the tannins, which are firm and astringent. Yet the wine, which contains small amounts of Merlot and Cabernet Franc, is remarkably ripe in blackberries, cherries and currants. Shows lots of elegance and complexity. Drink it over the next six years. S.H.  (2/1/2012)  — 91 		From song written by Jimi Hendrix in 1967. 																		No	2019-01-25 13:32:37	2019-01-25 13:32:37

Jacinto Jaure Winery		JJ Gran Reserva Malbec Blend	2003	Premium	Malbec/cab/syrah	750 mL	Argentina	Mendoza	$80.00		Wine Chest	Row 2/bin 2	3		12		2024	The 2003 JJ Jacinto Jaure Gran Reserva is a blend of Malbec (40%), Cabernet Sauvignon (30%), and Syrah (30%). The fruit was sourced from a 53-year-old vineyard and aged for 18 months in new French oak before being bottled unfiltered. Purple in color, it has a fragrant bouquet of pain grille, Asian spices, pencil lead, black cherry, blueberry, and black currant. Ripe and sweet on the palate, it has plenty of silky tannin well concealed under a blanket of fruit. Nicely balanced and lengthy, it will evolve for 6-8 years and drink well through 2025.

Enjoyed two bottles with beef stroganoff; with joan and donn and ernie and zita -- dec. 7, 2013. Wow, what a great party and what a fine wine. Great evening!		The 2007 vintage was one of the greatest in Chateauneuf-du-Pape in history; now a very expensive vintage. This wine is full bodied, dense and indeed cellar worthy. This is primarily Grenache with smaller parts of the other regional grape varietals including Cinsault, Syrah and Mourvedre.																		No	2019-01-25 13:32:37	2019-01-25 13:32:37						
A purple- red garnet hue. Dense and packed aromas of black cherries, black raspberries, and dark red fruit with touches of cassis and pepper. On the palate, full bodied, juicy and nicely textured with good depth. Bountiful flavors of black cherries, blackberries, licorice, black and red currants, intermixed with pepper, herbs, lavender, incense and spice. Nice complexity in a full bodied but lush style with pleasant tannins. This wine should be aerated to enjoy now and is made to cellar over the next 7-10 years.

Cameron Confidential: The classic "Rutherford dust" fine-grained, supple tannins identified with this region enable this wine to be enjoyable young but make no doubt those that cellar this wine will be greatly rewarded. This wine is one of a series of wines we will be producing with one of Napa Valley’s premier grape growing families. It’s a match made in Heaven. They own and farm thousands of Napa Valley’s best dirt, but have only a small brand of their own.			Yes																	No	2019-01-25 13:32:37	2019-01-25 13:32:37

The palate is medium-bodied with ripe, fine tannins surrounding a core of pure blackberry and wild strawberry fruit, interlaced by lemon rind and dark chocolate towards the controlled, refined finish.

It's a blend of 50 pct Sauvignon blanc and 25 pct each of semillon and chardonnay. The Sauvignon blanc adds acidity which balances the oily, honeyed semillon and then you get some new world Chardonnay tropical fruit but not enough to irritate. Weird and delicious, will be a summer staple and probably very good with Szechuan or traditional Thai food, shrimp, grilled chicken.

Tiare Imperiale is only released in the top vintages and the 2010 is the first release since the 2007. This is a beautifully made and gorgeous Chateauneuf with extreme value for such a collectible vintage. A compelling taste profile and an age-worthy Chateauneuf du pape, it is a blend of all the regional grape varietals including Grenache, Syrah, Cinsault and Mourvedre. Opaque with shades of purple, black and red. Classical and distinguished aromas of lush black raspberries and black cherry shining through with touches of kirsch and spring flowers. A generous and silky palate of sweet black cherry jam, kirsch, licorice, toasty vanilla oak and red currants, with hints of dark chocolate, blueberry, boysenberry and a spice box. Made in a smooth velvety style with round tannins. This wine should still be aerated for early enjoyment and is made to cellar for many years.	Winery notes: This Chateauneuf-du-Pape is characteristic of its appellation with its beautiful purple colour. On the nose, it develops a complex bouquet of red fruit aromas mingling with truffles and spices. The mouth, robust and generous, displays a structure which will enable it to gain in quality over time. It is a perfect match for game, venison, meat cooked in sauces and all strong cheeses.

Beautifully delineated layers of dark fruit, mocha, espresso, licorice, leather and spices. This is an unusually ripe, expansive Tassinaia with enough richness and sheer pedigree to challenge some of the estate’s more expensive bottlings. Sweet grilled herbs and spices add a final flourish on the powerful close, with notes of brightness from the Sangiovese that act as a foil to some of the darker nuances in the wine.

A full-bodied white with rich, ripe pear fruit that develops into floral and herby peachiness. The wine has a long leesy character and fresh acidity. Attractive when young but worth leaving for a couple of years, which will allow the wine to develop some wonderful nutty and mineral notes. 8 year ageing potential, possibly even a decade. A real treat on its own or with goat's milk or sheep's milk cheeses, delicate pork or full flavoured fish dishes with cream and herbs such as dill. Also goes well with shellfish and pretty much any seafood and stands up well to rich cream sauces.	Will enjoy this with swordfish on Meg's visit to check out her dad on Feb. 24, 2016.

Macauley Vineyards		Old Vine Zinfandel	2010	Premium	Zinfandel	750 mL	United States	Napa	$45.00		Wine Rack 3	Row 5/bin 3	1		12		2019	Only 375 cases made.  "This is perhaps the smoothest, silkiest and most seductive tasting Zinfandel I’ve ever made.  The color is an amazing and dark garnet followed by richness and ripeness found in Zins that come only ever so often. The aromatics are well stacked in the glass beginning with sweet red fruit and flowed by barrel vanillin and sweet cocoa. Lastly the typical Zin white pepper and spice finds its place in the furthermost layers of the nose. Moving from the aromatics to the first taste, getting to enjoy this wine is a much anticipated event. The flavors are a pleasant twist of blackberry, vanilla, cassis and sweet density from old vine age supported by the oak. Tannin and acid are interlaced as well offering plenty for this rich Zinfandel to support itself upon. A polished and pleasing wine that rides the fine line of ripeness with textured mouthfeel and finish that satisfies for over 45 seconds after the first taste. I would anticipate this wine drinking well from inception to 2019 and well beyond." - Kirk Venge, Winemaker	Highly recommended by Terry at Schneider's.  For a special evening with Louise.

Dinastia Vivanco		Crianza	2008	Premium	Tempranillo	750 mL	Spain	Rioja					1		12		2018	WA: Balsam wood, tobacco, cinnamon, clove, violets, and black fruit aromas lead to a ripe, sweetly-fruited, nicely proportioned Crianza that is likely to blossom for another 1-2 years and drink well through 2020. Bodega Dinastia Vivanco is a must visit for wine tourists. The winery is designed to be accessible to visitors but the principal attraction is the finest wine museum I have ever seen. Called Museo de la Cultura del Vino, it is beautifully designed and filled to the brim with artifacts from all aspects of wine from farming to drinking. As for the wines, Dinastia Vivanco has been flying under the radar screen but with a new importer on board, it is highly likely that their wine will receive greater exposure.

Situated in the southern alluvial plains of the Russian River Valley, Dairyman Vineyard’s proximity to the Pacific Ocean results in a cool morning fog and afternoon coastal breezes that elongate the growing season. This gives us small, concentrated and flavorful berries, producing bright cherry characteristics, brown spices, and a keen minerality overlaid with a rich, velvety mouth feel. Once an old dairy farm, the pastureland was planted to Dijon clone Pinot Noir in 2000, preserving the deep agricultural history of the property.

The Odyssey Vineyard is located right next to the famed Stagecoach Vineyard and has a similar stylized taste of other nice Syrahs made in this viticultural are like Krupp Brothers and Tallulah. Arger-Martucci is one of those top boutique Napa houses that only release their vintages when the wine is drinking optimally so this wine has only been released in the past year. 2007 is one of the top vintages in the last decade and it is getting quite rare to find these wines now as they got snapped up shortly after release. These Mountain vines from the Odyssey and Isabella Vineyards are low yielding and sit at an elevation of 1,250 and 1,350 feet. This wine spent 11 months in primarily new American oak. Only about 750 cases were produced. Penetrating aromas of crème de cassis, dark cherries, licorice and white pepper. The fruit is lush and full bodied with chocolate covered cherries, blackberries, mocha, and well integrated oak with touches of nutmeg and cinnamon. A smooth mouth feel, it has a long, pleasant finish. While drinking beautifully now, it certainly has many more years to go. Steaks or veal chops!

Casey Flat Ranch		CFR Estate Red Wine	2010	Premium	Cab/Syrah/Cab Franc	750 mL	United States	Capay Valley	$62.00		Wine Rack 3	Row 2/bin 5	3		12		2024	This wine is far superior to the 2009 vintage which received quite strong ratings. This picturesque Vineyard sits on a 2,000 ft. rocky mountain slope. The winery is located about 22 miles from Napa Valley’s St. Helena appellation. Owner Allison Morey believes this is their best vintage ever and is rightfully proud of this monumental wine. It is mainly Cabernet Sauvignon with Cabernet Franc and Syrah. A deep purple hue. A distinguished nose of black cherries, kirsch and red flowers with thyme and violets. A palate that is both big and elegant with satin textured fruit including blackberry, black raspberry, mocha, dark chocolate, sweet vanilla oak and spice. Plump with smooth tannins and a long, persistent finish. The wine is quite cellar worthy and will drink nicely over the next 12 years and should age with elegance. Only 1,116 cases produced. Tasted in September and October 2013 with consistent tasting notes. It should pair nicely with Beef Wellington, steak friites, and leg of lamb with mint jelly, veal medallions in a rich sauce, grilled meats or dark chocolate.

RP: 92. A ripe, voluptuous wine that’s loaded with sweet kirsch, plum, licorice and garrigue aromas and flavors, Bravay’s 2011 Chateauneuf-du-Pape is a great example of the vintage. A field blend that’s close to 90% Grenache and aged all in tank (it sees no wood whatsoever), it’s a gorgeous, naked expression of Grenache that delivers medium to full-bodied richness, no hard edges and a supple, downright sexy profile. While it won’t make you run out and sell off your 2007s and 2010s, it’s a great wine meant for drinking over the coming 8-9 years. Drink now-2023. (JD) Located in the northern sector of Chateauneuf du Pape, these classic, traditional efforts are made by Philippe Bravay. They always emphasize purity and finesse, and are highly recommended.

It is hard to believe that the yields on the 2013 vintage were 30% lower than the tiny 12 vintage. While the yields were historically small and there is not much to go around, both vintages had extraordinary quality. Fragrant aromas of citrus fruit with touches of pineapple and lemon zest. A clean and refreshing palate of green apple, key lime and creamy lemon with notes of minerality, white flowers and Asian spice. A pleasing mouth feel and a long, clean finish.

RP94 The Wine Advocate - "The 2011 Reserva Old Vines (around 70 years of age on average) spent 18 months in 65% new and 35% used barriques (85% French, the rest American). The used barriques were previously new on the 2010 Reserva Old Vines. About the only bad thing you can say about this is that it is too marked by oak in its youth, but that is always true when it is young. That will become much better in time. Some cellaring will provide additional complexity as well, but it is otherwise quite approachable now even if not showing us all that it has to give. For my money, this is easily on the short list as a contender for “Best Reserva Old Vines” ever, because of its combination of concentration, lift, structure and superb balance. This is not the wine in the lineup that will always make you go “wow.” There is not a hint of bombast. However, it does everything beautifully, and balance is its hallmark. Even as it tightens with air, it proves how harmonious it is, showing off its finesse, crispness and focus. The fruit always seems fresh and lively here, never ponderous. The next day it hardly seemed changed. This should age pretty nicely. If all that is not enough, it is pretty tasty, too, a wine that will be hard to dislike on all fronts. Considering the price point, this is a "can’t miss" buy. There were 93,000 bottles produced. " 																				No	2019-01-25 13:32:38	2019-01-25 13:32:38						
WE94 Wine Enthusiast - "A dark and powerfully rich wine from one of the top quintas in the Douro. It shows great concentration from the old vines.

Wine Advocate: Drink: 2016 - 2025 Composed of sweet berry fruit and floral tones that are embellished with heavier layers of toasted oak and hazelnut. The wine shows budding complexity and needs a few more years to find balance. The Cannubi cru often shapes Nebbiolo with a large floral component including red rose and dried lavender. You definitely get a sense of that in the refined 2010 vintage. Soft tannins and sour cherry flavors characterize the finish. This estate shows particular confidence when it comes to the copious use of French oak. 		Do not drink before 2017	No										94							No	2019-01-25 13:32:38	2019-01-25 13:32:38

You can taste the youth of the wine in its evident fruit tones of plush cherry and dark prune, but you also get a sense of where the wine is headed down the road. The acidity and structure are well-suited for additional years of cellar aging. In terms of base Barbaresco from 2011, this wine certainly delivers the goods and offers great value along the way.

It’s a very unique small production cuvee with only several hundred cases produced each vintage and this is from one of the tiniest vintages in the past twenty years. It’s a Grenache-Mourvedre-Syrah blend from 40 year-old vines. A deep red garnet hue.

Veeder	$85.00		Wine Chest	Row 3/bin 2	1		12		2025	Over many decades, Mayacamas Vineyards has garnered a reputation for consistently producing one of the longest-lived, classic style Cabernet Sauvignons in the Napa Valley. Fresh and vibrant in its youth, Mayacamas Cabernet ages effortlessly in the cellar. The 2009 vintage is no exception – the effusive nose is packed with aromas of black cherry, wild strawberry, sage, licorice, fig and red rose, while the bright acidity and firm but elegant tannins suggest much life ahead. Full of spirit and energy, 2009 is a classic year for Mayacamas. In the vineyard, the grapes were harvested early to retain bright acidity and firm tannins. After fermentation in cement vessels built in the 1950’s, the wines aged in mostly neutral wood – a combination of large format foudre and small barrique - for three years before bottling.

		Food Pairing: Goat cheese or Epoisses (as per. Mme Bressand) trout, halibut, chowder. Ideal as an aperitif.Winemaking NotesThe vineyards are from well exposed, southeast facing clay/limestone slopes, 350 meters high, located in the limestone riddled "Le Mont" overlooking the river Saone to the east. Vire-Clesse was recently upgraded from Macon-Villages to having its own AC (about half the size of Pouilly-Fuisse and St.-Veran) in 1998, as its wines are world class. Back in the late nineteenth century, reference was made to some Premier Cru vineyards in the area, and there is discussion that vineyards like these may one day have the Premier Cru designation. Natural acidity levels were such that the wine delivered nice, crisp tension, and a refreshing, clean balance. It has an elegant structure similar to that of the 2000, 2005 and 2010 vintages. The harvest took place September 15th-22nd, by hand. Vinification, M/L [100%] and ageing in 600 liter 2-5 year old oak barrels. Bottling occurred after fining and a light filtration on June 25th 2015, with DIAM cork. The total production was 24,000 bottles.																		No	2019-01-25 13:32:38	2019-01-25 13:32:38

Xavier Vignon considers the 2010 Châteauneuf-du-Pape Cuvée Anonyme, along with the sensational 2007, to be the two greatest wines he’s ever made. Deep purple to the rim, with explosive aromas of crushed raspberry and dark plum, the attack is terrifically concentrated, packed with red-fruit preserves, though still marvelously high-toned and compact. While the finished wine came in at a whopping 16% alcohol, you’ll never know it. In this one-of-a-kind harvest, even as sugars spiked, acids remained firm, pH a riveting 3.45.

Bright purple. Expansive black and blue fruit scents are complicated by notes of smoky minerals, licorice, cola and mocha, with a peppery nuance adding lift. Smooth and broad on the palate, offering sweet blackcurrant and bitter chocolate flavors and a sexy violet pastille quality.

Cuvee Ste. Verge		Chateauneuf-du-Pape	2012	Premium	GSM	750 mL	France	Southern Rhone Valley			Rhone Rack	Row 3/bin 2	3		12		2022	The 2012 vintage in the Rhone Valley’s CDP region was far superior to the 2011 and 2013 vintages. The 2012 is much more fruit forward and distinctive than the last vintage of this wine that I sampled. Cellier des Princes’ 2012 Saint Vierge won the Gold Medal at France’s G & G International wine competition. The Winery has been producing CDP for over 90 years and this is one of their top cuvees. It is 90 percent Grenache and is from 30-40 year-old vines planted in clay soil. This wine is built for age so it still has a long way to go and should gain nice complexity and style over time. A nice sip of rich and layered fruit, especially the pretty black cherries with dark raspberry, vanilla oak, currants, plum, earth, and a nutmeg spice box with a mounting finish. Pair with Beef Wellington, lamb chops with a savory rosemary sauce, beef stew in red wine sauce, and veal medallions in a port wine reduction. Best enjoyed 2016-2022.

		Selected from four vineyards within McLaren Vale and sourced from mature vines between 20-40 years of age. The parcels for this wine were fermented separately in open fermenters before being gently pressed and matured in a combination of large and small French Oak Barrels. The wine spends up to 20 months in oak before being carefully blended together. 																		No	2019-01-25 13:32:38	2019-01-25 13:32:38

Our home vineyard was first planted in 1897 and these century old vines still bear fruit today. It is our family commitment to make wines that reveal the unique place that is McLaren Vale, and to show our efforts from the vineyard to the bottle.

The nose is impressively aromatic and sets the table for a wine that has a compelling, rich taste profile. Aromas of dark chocolate covered cherries, and dark raspberry with notes of mocha, and toasty vanilla oak. A big, expressive and luscious palate that deserves cellar time. An expressive and delicious fruit profile of blackberry pie, cherry, toffee, cassis, dark chocolate, coffee, violets and sweet vanilla oak. The wine is complex with a distinguished and pleasing finish. Best enjoyed through 2023. Napa Valley’s Celadon restaurant features the inspired cuisine of Chef Marcos Uribe. Pair this delightful Cabernet with his specialties including crispy soy-braised pork belly, beef satay with spicy peanut sauce, Akaushi hangar steak, jerk marinated pork porterhouse and Moroccan Lamb shank with almond couscous.

		Vineyard notes: The grapes for the wine came from the Hillside Crest vineyard that is located on the lower slopes of the Spring Mountain AVA in the Napa Valley and neighbors the famed Spring Mountain Vineyards. The vineyard has a legacy dating back to the late 1880s and features excellent drainage that has forced the vines’ roots deep into the soil searching for nutrients, thereby concentrating the grape’s flavor and helping to provide balanced acidity. Comprised of 5 acres, the Hillside Crest vineyard is planted in a variety of soils that range from silty loam and red volcanic earth. The difference in soils adds a subtle diversity to the grape flavors, which in turn leads to a complex and nuanced wine that features flavors of ripe cherry and other red fruits. Fruit notes are bolstered by the grapes’ natural tannin that is further accentuated by aging in a mix of neutral and new French oak barrels. The oak provides a lengthy finish that includes slight notes of cinnamon and other spices. 																		No	2019-01-25 13:32:38	2019-01-25 13:32:38

The mature grapes are gently harvested by skilled vineyard workers who also know to avoid under ripe or damaged clusters. Such “field sorting” makes processing the grapes at the winery much easier and quicker. The grapes are first destemmed and then lightly crushed before being transferred to small stainless steel and oak open-top fermentors. Fermentation is allowed to commence naturally, and the wild yeast provide for some interesting flavor and aroma characteristics to develop before a winery yeast strain completes the fermentation. Regular punch downs promote extraction, provide oxygen for the yeast and also moderate temperatures by breaking up any hot spots in the cap. Once it’s dry, the wine is pressed and aged for 14 months in mostly neutral but a few new French oak barrels. 																				No	2019-01-25 13:32:38	2019-01-25 13:32:38

Canoe Ridge Vineyard		Reserve Cherry Street Red Wine Blend	2010	Premium		750 mL			$37.00		Wine Rack 3	Row 5/bin 5	4		12		2020	Frontier Canoe Ridge Vineyard 2010 Reserve Cherry Street Red Blend Horse Heaven HillsCanoe Ridge Vineyard is one of Washington State’s most recognized wineries, with an estate vineyard in the Horse Heaven Hills American Viticultural Area, focused on Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot and Chardonnay. It is located at the center part of the state, along the Columbia River on the southern border of the state. The “Canoe Ridge” name is based on the ridge landmass near the vineyard, where famed explorers Lewis & Clark named this crest of land on their 1805 exploration. From the river, the adventurers thought the ridge resembled an overturned canoe. The winery celebrates 20 years of winemaking in 2014, and has earned more than 30 scores of 90 points or higher from critical wine publications such as Wine Spectator, Wine Enthusiast, Wine & Spirits, and Tasting Panel Magazine. This year, its 2010 Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon was named a “Year’s Best Cabernet” in Wine & Spirits Magazine.WinemakingWinemaker Bill Murray, with more than 20 years of winemaking experience, honors the old world style-winemaking traditions for which Canoe Ridge is beloved. The wines are made with structure and softness, and pair to a variety of cuisines. The winery features several 1,000 to 6,000 gallon fermenters, sized to complement fermentation by vineyard blocks (helping monitor quality as well as control for blending options). Murray enjoys experimentation with yeasts as well as a diverse cooperage of French, American and European oak. Depending on the varietal and program, wines spend a minimum of 18-24 months in oak.VineyardsPlanted in 1989 our estate vineyard in the Horse Heaven Hills AVA is comprised of 182 prolific acres. Perched on a ridge, the vines are planted on their own roots on a sloping ridge at 425-740 feet in elevation. Here, the well-drained sandy loam soils allow deep rooting. Cool nights provide ideal temperatures for excellent sugar to acid balance, and low rainfall (about 6-8” annually) translates to excellent flavor concentration. The vineyard’s latitude and south- and north-facing orientations help vines soak up more than 17 hours of sunshine per day at the peak of summer, resulting in rich, fully mature flavors and the river winds offer well-developed, fine tannins. Horse Heaven Hills AVAEstablished in 2005, the Horse Heaven Hills growing area is home to more 90+ scores of Cabernet Sauvignon than anywhere else in Washington State.-Precipitation: Average of eight inches annually, usually during dormancy; very limited irrigation prevents vine canopy growth and results in well-balanced grape characteristics.-Topography: Mostly south-facing sloped, well-drained sandy soils dotted with dry plains, lending optimal sun exposure for ripening and protective air drainage, ideal in winter months.-Temperature: Warmer growing season fully matures grapes earlier in the harvest season (decreasing the risk of fall frost).-Wind: Brisk wind patterns contribute to less of a leaf canopy and more sun exposure to help with ripening while naturally preventing pests.

Cutting the cépage nearly down the middle with 60% Grenache and 40% Syrah draws upon the two grapes' natural ability to complement and contrast each other in all of the right places.

This is a blend from their top estate vineyards in the Willamette Valley which include Daffodil, Wolf Hill and Newton. I recently met in the Willamette Valley and sampled a large selection of their barrels with the winemaking team and this vintage shines on every front. The weather completely cooperated and helped produce rich and delicious wines that are lush and fruit forward. This wine is grown in unique soil that is well known for the Obsidian, as it is for red volcanic Jury soil. Obsidian is naturally occurring volcanic glass. When lava from a volcano cools rapidly, it causes an “obsidian flow.” This sharp edged glass is a big part of the history of the Willamette Valley, as Native Americans utizlied it extensively to create cutting tools. This wine is too delicious to not enjoy now, but it certainly has a long-term ability to age, and will gain complexity. This tiny production 100% Pinot Noir is a rich and generous red that includes a dazzling inner core of loaded, fresh cut fruit. It is predominantly red cherries, with red raspberries, crème de cassis, and wild strawberries, with touches of red flowers, smoke and a spice box. It finishes quite nicely. Sampled in the summer of 2015 in barrel, and the fall of 2015 in bottle with consistent tasting notes.		No	2019-01-25 13:32:38	2019-01-25 13:32:38

The 2012 Châteauneuf du Pape Alexis Establet is a knockout effort that has fabulous fruit intensity, medium to full-bodied richness and a sexy, voluptuous style. Coming all from 100+-year-old Grenache vines planted in sand and pebble soils, and aged 12 months in foudre and oak tanks, it gives up notions of black raspberry, mulled blackberries, crushed flowers and herbes de Provence. Domaine du Grand Tinel is run with considerable success by the Jeaune Family, with consulting advice from Philippe Cambie. A large estate, it covers over 130 acres spread throughout the appellation. They produce an outstanding white as well as two Chateauneufs in most vintage, a classic cuvee made from mostly Grenache, and the cuvee Alexis Establet, which is 100% Grenache from ancient vintage. Elevage here is a mix of modern and traditional, with the grapes completely destemmed and aging occurring mostly in foudre, with some stainless steel and small barrels. Importer(s): Serge Dore.

Intl. Wine Report: 91+. Drink 2018-2028. The 2012 'Cuvée Alexis Establet' comes from an area known as the 'La Gardiole' at the northernmost point of the appellation. The wine itself is made in a classic style and opens up with aromas of dark raspberry compote, plums, garrigue and minerals before slowly adding in some chocolate notes and a black olive character. This delivers a medium-full body with fine tannins which are firmly structured around a racy core. Today, the wine is still at a primal stage, so just allowing this extended air contact alone is not enough, this will require several years of age before it should even be considered, that being said this has plenty of potential and a bright future ahead.

[Information provided by Olivier Nouet]beautifully Provencal, medium to full-bodied, polished effort that will evolve gracefully for 10-12 years. This was a rock-star lineup by Mireille Porte, and these wines go from strength to strength across the lineup. Located in southern part of the appellation, she releases two classic cuvees, the Cuvee Des Deux Sœurs and the Cuvee du Lion, and a more modern-style cuvee called Feminessance.

		Louise purchased this wine at the PEO wine auction in 2017 for $150. The 2013 vintage in Conn Valley was one of ther best on record. Spring was warm and dry, and bud break was early. This got the vines off to a vigorous start and flowering and fruit set went off without a hitch. A short hot spell towards the end of June into early July was the only note of concern, and the vines came into veraison early and in very fine shape.

The harvest was one of the earliest on record, beginning on August 1st for the whites. A little rain fell in September, but it didn’t seem to have much impact as sunny, drying conditions filled in after the rains and the vineyards dried out quickly.

Cool, sunny, and dry conditions prevailed through October and kept sugars and acids in balance, allowing for a little extra time on the vine for maturing flavors and phenolics and leaving a healthy, ripe, and concentrated crop ready for picking.

On the whole, about two weeks earlier than average, and a lot of growers are calling it a “near perfect” vintage — an even-tempered growing season that yielded a good-sized crop of small, concentrated berries. Beautiful weather with really no extremes and not too much rain has growers singing the praises of this excellent vintage, which produced another large crop of healthy, balanced fruit and very high-quality wines.

We give it a very strong buy recommendation, as these are wines many believe will rival or even surpass the 2012s — high praise for sure! Big, powerful reds; bright, lively, and rich whites. HYPERLINK "https://www.wineaccess.com/search/varietal/pinot_noir/"Pinot Noir was a particular success in most regions, with optimum ripeness and very good acidities too.

It sports a deep ruby color, full body, terrific Grenache notes of black raspberries, scorched earth, currants and roasted herbs, sweet tannin and a killer finish. It’s more streamlined and elegant than the 2007 or 2010, but should surpass the 2009, which seems to be on a fast evolutionary track. Didier Negron has been the winemaker at this remarkable estate since 2001, and he’s yet to put a foot wrong. It’s important to realize that the estate makes four Châteauneuf du Pape cuvées: the entry level Les Olivets (which was first made in 1955) from younger vines and completely destemmed; the Cuvee Reserve from a single vineyard and 70-80% Grenache, and the rest Syrah and Mourvèdre, aged in foudre and oak tanks; the Cuvee Prestige based on 70% Grenache, 20% Syrah and the rest mostly Mourvèdre that’s aged in foudre, oak tanks and demi-muids; and the smallest production cuvée (there’s normally just 100 cases produced), the Le Secret des Sabon based mostly on Grenache.

The 2015 Châteauneuf du Pape Prestige includes slightly more Syrah than the other cuvées and is 70% Grenache, 20% Syrah, 5% Mourvèdre and the rest a mix of permitted varieties. It’s easily the largest, richest and most full-bodied of the lineup and has lots of blackberry, plum, peppery herbs and roasted herb characteristics. Like all of the 2015s here, it has serious purity, as well as ripe tannin.																				No	2019-01-25 13:32:38	2019-01-25 13:32:38

As this opens in the glass, it releases wonderful, nuanced aromatics of dark cherries, raspberries, and plum woven together with spices, white pepper, lavender and hints of black olives and stony minerals. This full-bodied red is beautiful structured with round, velvety tannins and displays excellent concentration and focus. The finish is long and expansive, underlined by a lovey touch of acidity keeping it fresh and inviting, as spices and pepper notes continue to linger along side dark fruits. Overall this is an absolutely gorgeous wine, which will be accessible early on and for years to come. (Best 2018-2028)		No	2019-01-25 13:32:38	2019-01-25 13:32:38

No	2019-01-25 13:32:38	2019-01-25 13:32:38						
The vintage’s milestones averaged two weeks early from bud break through harvest, with some sites and varieties maturing as much as three weeks early. Growing conditions were mostly dry and warmer than normal throughout the spring providing a great environment for flowering and fruit set. The result was large clusters that ripened evenly over the course of the warm, dry summer. The 2014 vintage broke the previous record for heat accumulation during the growing season, set in 2006. 																				No	2019-01-25 13:32:38	2019-01-25 13:32:38

This is one of those rare vintages when you have high quality and high quantity simultaneously.

Appearance: Nearly opaque purple ruby core with moderate plus intensity toward the rim with slow-forming, well stained tears in the glass. Aroma: Aromatic and complex with ripe black fruit of blackberry, dusty cherry and blueberry with sweet spice of vanilla with cinnamon and savory spice of cracked pepper, with smoky, meaty notes and leather. Palate: Bold, full bodied and complex with ripe black fruit of berries and cherry combined with baking spice on the entry with smoky, savory elements of dusty leather, tobacco leaf and cracked pepper and subtle notes of cured salumi emerging as the mid-palate continues. The exceptionally long finish is clean, complex and balanced, layered with continually evolving fruit and savory flavors supported by dense chewy tannins and a little cocoa. We suggest a couple years of aging after release to show its full, complex potential on its own, but if you have a few bottles of 2015 FOCUS on hand, you might what to enjoy a bottle earlier with a robust winter dish like a slowly cooked beef ragu, or braised lamb shanks with polenta for a special treat while you are waiting for the others to evolve.

Wine Advocate: The 2015 Chateauneuf du Pape Cuvee Alexis Establet is a pure Grenache wine raised in a combination of foudres, demi-muids, and new barriques.

Of its total 40 hectares of vines, 13 hectares produce their red wines. "Antonin" is their majestic top Châteauneuf cuvée, crafted from 100% Grenache vines planted on the Plateau de Fargueirol (indeed, this cuvée comes completely from the original Fargueirol lieu-dit).  This is the heartland of Grenache itself, where this grape varietal reaches its full potential to express the deepest intricacies of the terroir. It brings smoothness and class to the wine, and a richness and opulence both in structure and in aromatic range. The galets roulés stones that define this terroir give us a wine of power and richness, with an intensity in the fruit and a roundness and complexity enveloping the silky tannins and spices.

This wine is a blend of 45% Syrah, 35% Alicante Bouschet, and 20% Touriga Nacional. Each variety takes on a different role in the wine. The Syrah brings structure, earth, and spice; the Alicante Bouschet adds a dimension of juicy dark fruit; and the Touriga Nacional pulls everything together with a floral lift. The wine reminds me of a cross between a Cote Rotie and a Chateauneuf du Pape - but at a fraction of the price.		No																		No	2019-01-25 13:32:38	2019-01-25 13:32:38
