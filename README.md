#drewCo.Tools
This is a utility library that I have been working on, and using in my personal projects for many years.  
It is kind of a grab bag of all sorts of functionality, but I am looking towards breaking it up into standalone components in the future.
At this time, it builds against .NET 4.7.2 but in the near future I will be a posting a .NET 5 port of the code for all future development.
